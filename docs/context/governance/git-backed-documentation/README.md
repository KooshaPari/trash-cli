# Git-Backed Documentation Framework

This framework makes PR-ready docs reproducible and review-friendly before coding starts.

## Order of Work (required)
1. `ADR` first: capture problem framing and decision boundaries.
2. `PRD` next: define scope, success criteria, and acceptance.
3. `FRs` then: decompose requirements into implementable packages.
4. `Plan` after FRs: batch execution sequence, dependencies, owners.
5. `Tests` before/alongside implementation: unit/integration/behavior coverage.

## Commit Batches
- **Batch A**: scaffolding + templates + ADR + PRD
- **Batch B**: FR docs + plan and dependency graph
- **Batch C**: test plan + execution + implementation-ready checklist

## Hard Rules
- One branch per active PR stack only.
- One batch per commit unless dependency forces a split.
- Target branch changes must be `main` descendants and pushed before PR creation.
- Any file >125 lines in this framework must be split before merge.

## Required Branch State
- Branch has upstream tracking.
- No unpushed commits on the source branch.
- Local branch sync is verified in CI before PR creation.
- Run this check before opening PRs:

```bash
git fetch
if git status --short --branch | rg -q "ahead"; then
  echo "FAIL: source branch is ahead of upstream"
  exit 1
fi
```
