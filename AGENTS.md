# AGENTS Guide

## Review Bot Governance

- Keep CodeRabbit PR blocking at the lowest level in `.coderabbit.yaml`: `pr_validation.block_on.severity: info`.
- Keep Gemini Code Assist severity at the lowest level in `.gemini/config.yaml`: `code_review.comment_severity_threshold: LOW`.
- Retrigger commands:
  - CodeRabbit: comment `@coderabbitai full review` on the PR.
  - Gemini Code Assist (when enabled in the repo): comment `@gemini-code-assist review` on the PR.
  - If comment-trigger is unavailable, retrigger both bots by pushing a no-op commit to the PR branch.
- Rate-limit discipline:
  - Use a FIFO queue for retriggers (oldest pending PR first).
  - Minimum spacing: one retrigger comment every 120 seconds per repo.
  - On rate-limit response, stop sending new triggers in that repo, wait 15 minutes, then resume queue processing.
  - Do not post duplicate trigger comments while a prior trigger is pending.
